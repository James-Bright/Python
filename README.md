Highlights of my python projects

The diabetes prediction notebook usis artificial neural networks implementing Keras. It also uses scikit-learn to implement a K-means clustering technique as an alternative model. Model accuracy is evaluated using confusion matrices for both. Data handling and import was done using Pandas and visualisation was handled using matplotlib.
